# Java 17
A short introduction into the new features introduced into Java with version 17.
The assumption is that you're currently working with Java 11.
Most of these features were actually introduced in versions between 11 and 17.

## reveal-js
This presentation is made in [reveal.js](https://revealjs.com/). You can download the `zip` frm there and unpack it to a directory called `reveal.js`

`index.html` references a *reveal.js* installation two levels up from the current directory.
So if this file is stored in directory `\user\code\java17`, a reveal.js installation is expected in a directory called `user\reveal.js`.
This can be changed by manually altering the references to reveal.js in `index.html`

Open [index.html](index.html) in any browser to start.
